## �📜 Project Abstract
The **Smart Receipt Analyzer** is a cloud-native web application designed to automate the expense tracking lifecycle. Hosted on a hybrid AWS architecture, it leverages **Amazon EC2** for the web interface and serverless AI services for backend processing.

Users upload receipt images via a mobile-friendly Flask web app. The system automatically:
1.  **Extracts Data**: Uses **Amazon Textract** (OCR) to read vendor names, dates, and totals.
2.  **Categorizes Expenses**: Uses **Amazon Bedrock** (LLM) to intelligently classify transactions (e.g., "Groceries", "Dining").
3.  **Stores Securely**: Saves images in a private **Amazon S3** bucket and metadata in **Amazon DynamoDB**.

## 🚀 Quick Start
To run this project locally or deploy it, please refer to the [Compute Setup Guide](docs/ec2_setup.md) for detailed installation instructions.

### Environment Config
Create a `.env` file with the following:
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket
DYNAMODB_TABLE=your-table
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=secret
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229
```
